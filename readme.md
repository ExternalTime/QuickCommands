# Quick Commands

A minecraft client mod.

Create command aliases and run them easily with `Quick Commands` key (`.` by
default). Handles suggestions and usable entirely through chat commands (i.e.
it doesn't have gui).

## Usage

`Quick Commands` key (`.` by default) opens chat window with
`/quickcommands run ` already typed in. Keybinding changeable in
`Options -> Controls -> Key Binds -> Multiplayer`.

Avialable commands:
1. `/quickcommands add [alias] [command]` - registers new alias,
2. `/quickcommands remove [alias]` - removes an alias,
3. `/quickcommands run [alias]` - executes command associated with an alias,
4. `/quickcommands list` - lists available commands,
5. `/quickcommands clear` - removes all aliases.

All commands have suggestions implemented to make them easier to use.
